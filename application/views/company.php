            	<div class="text_holder"><strong>It’s better for the Environment</strong><br />It’s an environmental issue with so many commuters on the road. By reducing the number of employees traveling into work, companies can help with environmental issues. Fewer greenhouse emulsions are being released with fewer employees driving and taking the bus. </div>
            	<div class="text_holder"><strong>Less Congestion on the Roads Improves Business Shipment and Receiving Rates</strong><br />The 2012 <a href="http://www.shrm.org/hrdisciplines/technology/articles/pages/study-examines-benefits-of-telework.aspx">Urban Mobility Report study</a> released February 2013 by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute states, “The cost of congestion is more than $120 billion, nearly $820 for every commuter in the U.S.”  Commuting employees are wasting time and money. This is affecting businesses that depend on shipments being received on time. Instead, their drivers, UPS, and FedEx drivers are held up as well in the congestion. </div>
            	<div class="text_holder"><strong>More Productive Employees</strong><br />By reducing time on the road and worries of getting home by a certain time to maintain family life, employees can focus more on their duties and be more productive workers. </div>
            <div class="text_holder"><strong>Increases a Company’s Bottom Line</strong><br />It also helps cut a company’s cost directly, affecting the bottom line. By increasing telecommute positions; a company can cut back on their real estate space, ultimately cutting back on additional equipment, supplies and utility costs. </div>
